# Credit Risk Assessment using Decision Trees

## Problem Statement
Develop a decision tree-based model to assess the credit risk of loan applicants based on various features such as credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, etc.

## Context
This project aims to assess the credit risk of loan applicants by developing a decision tree-based model that predicts whether an applicant is a high or low credit risk. The dataset contains credit-related information, including credit score, income, and other financial details. The objective is to accurately predict the credit risk of new loan applicants, aiding financial institutions in making informed loan approval decisions and minimizing the risk of loan defaults.
